It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight.[4] Glycogen, the glucose store of animals, is a more highly branched version of amylopectin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn industry, starch is converted into sugars, for example by malting, and fermented to produce ethanol in the manufacture of beer, whisky and biofuel. It is processed to produce many of the sugars used in processed foods. Mixing most starches in warm water produces a paste, such as wheatpaste, which can be used as a thickening, stiffening or gluing agent.

Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\\r\\nSnip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.\\r\\nFor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.\\r\\nFor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.\\r\\nFor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.\\r\\nFor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.\\r\\nFor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.\\r\\nOnce all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.\",\n    \"description\": \"A hearty breakfast meal consisting of eggs, bacon, sausage, baked beans, grilled tomato, and toast.

Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\\r\\nSnip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.\\r\\nFor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.\\r\\nFor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.\\r\\nFor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.\\r\\nFor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.\\r\\nFor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.\\r\\nOnce all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.\",\n    \"description\": \"Similar to the English Breakfast, but with additional items like black pudding, fried mushrooms, and hash browns.

If you’re having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up – don’t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaste the jerk mixture for seasoning – it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it’s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well balanced.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you’re ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 mins. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45 mins until tender and cooked through.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 mins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdd the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy.\",\n    \"description\": \"A popular Jamaican dish made with chicken that has been marinated in a spicy mixture of jerk seasoning, then grilled or roasted.

To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins – when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.\\r\\nFor the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above, but don’t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.\\r\\nTo assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake.\\r\\nTake 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.\\r\\nCarefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.\\r\\nAssemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days.

Warm a 20cm (measured across the top) non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork so they break up and mix, but not as completely as you would for scrambled egg. With the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of butter into the pan. It should bubble and sizzle, but not brown. Season the eggs with the Parmesan and a little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan.\\r\\nLet the eggs bubble slightly for a couple of seconds, then take a wooden fork or spatula and gently draw the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in the centre. Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked egg with cooked. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there’s some barely cooked egg left. With the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top. A quick burst of heat will brown the underside.\\r\\nGrip the handle underneath. Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge. Fold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate – or fold it in half, if that’s easier. For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers. Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze.

Lay the duck legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2 days ahead.\\r\\nPour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat. As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.) After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool.\\r\\nThe duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately – or you can follow the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead, pack the duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.\\r\\nTo reheat and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Remove the legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan. Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp.

Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the package directions. The pasta should be tender but still chewy.\\r\\n2. While the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.\\r\\n3. Drain the pasta in a colander. Place the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat and add the butter. When the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute. Watch carefully so it does not scorch on the bottom of the pan.\\r\\n4. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into the flour mixture until everything is really well combined. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Then stir in the drained cooked pasta.\\r\\n5. Line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter. Pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. Coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake the grilled cheese\\r\\n6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.\\r\\n7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended.\\r\\n8. Remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Carefully cut into 8 equal pieces. Each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (You can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.)\\r\\n9. Spread 3/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. Place half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. Top each with one slice of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (Transfer from the baking sheet by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each. Finish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up.\\r\\n10. Using a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. Cover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more.\\r\\n11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Set everything aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 4\\r\\nAdd 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 5\\r\\nSquash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 6\\r\\nWhile the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 7\\r\\nLeave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 8\\r\\nKeep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 9\\r\\nMix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 10\\r\\nTake the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 11\\r\\nAdd extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTEP 12\\r\\nUse a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.

It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight.[4] Glycogen, the glucose store of animals, is a more highly branched version of amylopectin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn industry, starch is converted into sugars, for example by malting, and fermented to produce ethanol in the manufacture of beer, whisky and biofuel. It is processed to produce many of the sugars used in processed foods. Mixing most starches in warm water produces a paste, such as wheatpaste, which can be used as a thickening, stiffening or gluing agent. The biggest industrial non-food use of starch is as an adhesive in the papermaking process.

Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon. Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory.

When the ham is tender enough to pull into shreds, it is ready.\\r\\nLift out the ham, peel off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a clean pair of rubber gloves), shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and stir in the frozen peas. Simmer for 1 min, then blend until smooth. Add a splash of water if too thick, and return to the pan to heat through if it has cooled, or if you are making ahead.\\r\\nWhen you are ready to serve, mix the hot soup with most of the ham – gently reheat if made ahead. Serve in bowls with the remaining ham scattered on top, and eat with crusty bread and butter.\",\n    \"description\": \"A classic French soup made with split peas, vegetables, and ham hock, simmered until tender and flavorful.\",\n    \"thumb\": \"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xxtsvx1511814083.jpg\",\n    \"preview\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678561362/b3qgguegyoe0as7c9asy.jpg\",\n    \"time\": \"150\",\n    \"popularity\": 0,\n    \"favorites\": [],\n    \"likes\": [],\n    \"youtube\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdhWz7qAaCU\",\n    \"tags\": [\"Soup\", \"Warm\"],\n    \"createdAt\": \"2023-03-11T19:25:33.243Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2023-03-22T11:57:08.984Z\",\n    \"ingredients\": [\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"1kg\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37fd\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Ham\",\n        \"desc\": \"A cut of meat from the hind leg of a pig that is typically cured or smoked, and is commonly used in sandwiches, salads, and as a flavoring for soups and stews.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564978/hbntweybw6wvy0wzeg14.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"200g (soaked overnight)\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e373c\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Peas\",\n        \"desc\": \"A type of legume with small, round, edible seeds, commonly used in soups, stews, and casseroles.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564855/fysi27rdu0tvx1o6ijbi.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"2 chopped\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e372e\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Onions\",\n        \"desc\": \"A bulb vegetable with layers of flesh covered by a paper-like skin, used in cooking for its flavor and texture.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564854/v68e3x3qklciznrsbjij.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"2 chopped\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3684\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Carrots\",\n        \"desc\": \"A root vegetable that is commonly used in cooking and baking, with a sweet and earthy flavor, and high in vitamin A and other nutrients.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564673/aoyitr2lgxl65uxtt3dn.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"2\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e366b\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Bay Leaves\",\n        \"desc\": \"The bay leaf is an aromatic leaf commonly used in cooking.

It was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade species, the thorn or bitter apple, S. incanum, probably with two independent domestications, one in South Asia and one in East Asia.\",\n        \"t\": \"Vegetable\",\n        \"thb\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"4 small\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37c8\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Fennel\",\n        \"desc\": \"A herb with a sweet, anise-like flavor commonly used in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine to add flavor to dishes.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564978/rwsyfsla2qufmrcgfdam.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"1 thinly sliced\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e374f\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Red Pepper\",\n        \"desc\": \"A sweet and crunchy vegetable that is often used in cooking and is a good source of vitamins A and C.

Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypes of paella include Valencian paella, vegetable paella (Spanish: paella de verduras), seafood paella (Spanish: paella de mariscos), and mixed paella (Spanish: paella mixta), among many others. Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe and consists of white rice, green beans (bajoqueta and tavella), meat (chicken, duck and rabbit), white beans (garrofón), snails, and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary. Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs use bomba rice due to it being less likely to overcook, but Valencians tend to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking) variety known as Senia. All types of paellas use olive oil.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678565048/nqifnokjg6ntqzqqlohm.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"1 tsp \",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3733\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Paprika\",\n        \"desc\": \"A spice made from ground dried peppers, commonly used in Hungarian, Spanish, and Indian cooking.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564856/uct0beorkq4pbydv4i8b.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"pinch\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e375a\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Saffron\",\n        \"desc\": \"Spice derived from the stigma of the saffron crocus flower, with a pungent flavor and bright yellow-orange color, often used in rice dishes, paella, and bouillabaisse.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564910/vmh7ijvs7nm2r74hxgi7.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"200ml\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3794\",\n        \"ttl\": \"White Wine\",\n        \"desc\": \"A type of wine made from white grapes, often used in cooking for its acidity and fruity flavor.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564914/kzfewsf0r62nmtwbczr5.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"700ml\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e378a\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Vegetable Stock\",\n        \"desc\": \"A liquid made by simmering vegetables in water with herbs and spices, used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564911/unhwboxyma2hyepvjigq.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"100g \",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3832\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Frozen Peas\",\n        \"desc\": \"Peas that have been blanched and frozen to preserve their flavor and texture.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"1 chopped\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3711\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Lemon\",\n        \"desc\": \"A citrus fruit that has a sour, acidic flavor and is often used in cooking and baking to add tartness and brightness to dishes.

You’ll need to check on the pot periodically for a stir and a top of of liquid if needed.\\r\\nAdd the lentils and chopped roasted squash.

Begin to puree, slowly adding about 1/2 cup fresh water, until a creamy consistency is reached. You may need to add less or more water to reach the desired consistency.\\r\\nAdd a pinch of sea salt and vinegar (or lemon juice).\",\n    \"description\": \"A hearty and flavorful vegetarian chili made with lentils and squash.\",\n    \"thumb\": \"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uwxqwy1483389553.jpg\",\n    \"preview\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678560401/n8vhngmdapxsuluq6eqf.jpg\",\n    \"time\": \"90\",\n    \"popularity\": 0,\n    \"favorites\": [],\n    \"likes\": [],\n    \"youtube\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKmqawK2Tqs\",\n    \"tags\": [\"Pulse\"],\n    \"createdAt\": \"2023-03-11T19:25:33.240Z\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2023-03-20T08:04:44.473Z\",\n    \"ingredients\": [\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"1 tbls\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e372c\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Olive Oil\",\n        \"desc\": \"A type of oil made from pressing whole olives, commonly used in cooking and as a salad dressing.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564854/hzcfvlja7hmbp84z7f3q.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"1\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37ae\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Onion\",\n        \"desc\": \"A bulb-shaped vegetable with multiple layers of papery skin and a pungent, sweet flavor, often used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces or caramelized as a topping for pizza or sandwiches.\",\n        \"t\": \"\",\n        \"thb\": \"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddbvbv5sp/image/upload/v1678564915/zh0gaow8d90isucakkau.png\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"measure\": \"1 chopped\",\n        \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3710\",\n        \"ttl\": \"Leek\",\n        \"desc\": \"A type of allium vegetable that is related to onions and garlic.
